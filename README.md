Hello everyone.
For my physics-based project, I created an HTML-based program to make fixture creation more practical. With this program, you can load your sprites and create fixtures. It supports both Convex and Concave shapes. I also added English support to make it easier for you to use.
It is completely free—feel free to use it however you like.
If I made any mistakes in my writing, I’m sorry, my English isn’t very good
